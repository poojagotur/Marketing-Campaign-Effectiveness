AB Testing analysis for marketing campaigns
Overview:
This notebook provides an in-depth analysis of a marketing A/B testing dataset, aiming to answer key questions related to campaign success and the impact of ads. A/B testing is a common method used by marketing companies to evaluate the effectiveness of different versions of variables, such as web pages or advertisements, by showing them to different segments of the audience simultaneously.

Dataset Description:
The dataset contains information about users' interactions with marketing campaigns, including whether they were exposed to ads or a public service announcement (PSA), their conversion status (whether they purchased the product), and additional features such as the total number of ads seen and the most active day and hour.

Table of Contents:
* Introduction: Context and objectives of the analysis.
* Importing Libraries: Libraries used for data analysis and visualization.
* Loading the Dataset: Retrieving the dataset from an external source.
* Dataset Overview: Summary statistics, null values, unique values, and duplicates.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and insights into the dataset.
* Hypotheses: Null and alternative hypotheses for statistical testing.
* Chi-square Test: Evaluation of the association between test groups and conversions.
